# stress_tester
A very simple program for testing your solutions for competetive programming. You need to have two programs: one with right solution and the other which can give you wrong answers. My stress tester simply otputs test which gave different answers for two solutions. But you need to change test generation in create_test.py by yourself. And maybe some constans in constants.py like name of your programs.

## Usage
Change names of the programs in constants.py. Specify if they are python programs or just a binaries in special constants. Write your own test generator. Run test.py
